I graduated from the University of Houston with a PhD degree in Computer Science (Spring 2018) where I was a part of the RiTUAL lab. My advisor was [Dr. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/). My research interest is in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). During my PhD, I mainly worked on different areas of authorship: authorship attribution, author profiling, and plagiarism detection. My dissertation is on authorship attribution in realistic scenarios, where I looked at cross-domain authorship attribution for a large number of authors.

Currently, I am a PostDoctoral RA at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory under [Dr. Svitlana Volkova](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~svitlana/). My main area of research is dynamic social network graphs and forecasting based on these graphs. I am also looking at how information about software vulnerabilities and cybersecurity spreads in social media (Twitter, Reddit, and Github) and figuring out the drivers of this spread. 
In addition, I am also working on result reproduction and error analysis of state of the art systems in machine comprehension, semantic role labeling, and named entity recognition.
